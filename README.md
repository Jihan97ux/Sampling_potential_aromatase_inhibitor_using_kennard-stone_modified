## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
Breast cancer remains a significant global health issue, with **2.3 million cases worldwide**, accounting for **11.7% of all cancer cases**. In Indonesia, it is the most prevalent cancer, with **68,858 cases and over 22,000 deaths** annually.  

The key factor in **breast cancer progression** is the **dysregulation of estrogen levels** facilitated by the **aromatase enzyme**. Aromatase inhibitors (**AIs**) have been widely used to suppress estrogen production. However, existing AIs often cause **cardiovascular issues and bone density loss**.  

This study employs **molecular fingerprint analysis** and **pIC50 bioactivity values** to identify potential **aromatase inhibitors**. Additionally, the **Kennard-Stone algorithm** is integrated to ensure a **representative selection of compounds** from a large dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives  
1. **Identify** potential aromatase inhibitor compounds with high **pIC50 values**.  
2. **Implement** the **Kennard-Stone algorithm** to select a diverse and representative dataset.  
3. **Evaluate** the effectiveness of the selected compounds through **molecular docking**.

- Distributes samples **evenly in feature space** for unbiased selection.  

### **3. Molecular Processing**  
- **SMILES representations** were converted into **PDB files** using **RDKit**.  
- **Geometric optimization** was applied using **Universal Force Field (UFF)**.  
- **3D Molecular Visualization** was performed using **Py3Dmol**.  

### **4. Computational Complexity Analysis**  
- Algorithm time complexity: **O(mÂ² * n)**, where **m** = number of samples, **n** = number of features.  
- Euclidean distance calculations and **feature normalization** were implemented to improve efficiency.
